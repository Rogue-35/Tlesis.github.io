        <p>
            Swerve Drive is a type of drive train in which each wheel can point 
            in any direction. Since the wheels can point in any direction, the 
            robot can move in any direction. Additionally, it can preform unique 
            maneuvers such as turning its wheels to form a circle and spinning 
            very quickly.

            Originally we, team 1810, were using a library called <a href="https://github.com/SwerveDriveSpecialties/swerve-lib" target="_blank">SDS</a>.
            This was because swerve drive is a very large departure from previous 
            year's drive trains, tank drive. Although SDS is great for getting 
            swerve set up quickly it isn't the best (in my opinion) for more 
            complex actions like auto and more low level control over motor 
            states. Because of the complexity of swerve it has taken me and the 
            other members of the programming sub-team multiple attempts to create 
            something functional. Currently there are three branches on the repository:

        <ul>
            <li><b><a style="color: #FAFAFA; font-style: normal;" href="https://github.com/Tlesis/1810-No-Sds">Main</a></b> - 
            Main is an old set of code and is also the only branch tested. Unfortunately it failed to work. Really it became more of a learning/testing branch than an actual one.</li>
            <li><b><a style="color: #FAFAFA; font-style: normal;" href="https://github.com/Tlesis/1810-No-Sds/tree/FusionCorps_Swerve">FusionCorps_Swerve</a></b> - 
            FusionCorps Swerve is a repo that my friend found and sent to me. It could work but I don't see much of a future with it.</li>
            <li><b><a style="color: #FAFAFA; font-style: normal;" href="https://github.com/Tlesis/1810-No-Sds/tree/WPI_Swerve">WPI_Swerve</a></b> - 
            WPI Swerve is me attempting to translate WPI lib's example project to work with our swerve modules. I have the highest hope for this working out of all of the branches.</li>
